<h3 align="left">THE /\RDNSCR PROJECT</h3>

###

<p align="left">After having made my interactive resume DOS menu as a "for fun" project, knowing I wouldn't be able to actually use it, since it'd be sketchy as heck just sending an unpromted batch script. 
  <br>My teacher encouraged me to make a website where I could show off my DOS themed resume. <br>
  <br>I did have to redo the DOS menu from batch to java script, but I had another teacher help me out troubleshoot.<br>
  
  <br>============ ============ ============ ============<br>
  
  <br>[ The website will be patched and tweaked as I get better at coding ]<br>
  -- The page is compatible with mobile devices, tho a lil funky</p>
